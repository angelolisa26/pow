# yiimp-kawpow

accepts shares and submits blocks, but is provided as is.
just like any custom yiimp stratum; this code is intended only to run kawpow-type coins, do not attempt to use it for standard coins as well.

donations welcome via btc (bc1qxpkvrj75caynzuu2hftrggscggax3cthkvq6n4)

find me on discord (barrystyle#3615)

note: to be fair, the stratum implementation originally planned and written for ravencoin was horrid; your mileage may vary (extranonce? whats that?)
